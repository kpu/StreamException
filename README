This is a simple (header and cc) library for C++ exceptions that lets you build error messages in-line.  

Here's an example:
int OpenReadOrThrow(const char *name) {
  int ret;
  UTIL_THROW_IF(-1 == (ret = open(name, O_RDONLY)), util::ErrnoException, "while opening " << name);
  return ret;
}

If the file does not exist, calling what() returns:
test.cc:45 in int OpenReadOrThrow(const char*) threw ErrnoException because `-1 == (ret = open(name, O_RDONLY))'.
No such file or directory while opening foo
